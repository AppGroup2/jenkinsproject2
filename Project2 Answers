Question 3

One of the advantages of using a multi-branch pipeline is that it allows developers to build and deploy multiple branches from a single repository.
The multi-branch pipeline also allows for different environments for different branches and keep track of changes occurring over time.

Question 5

It is important to use conditional check. Thus, we can use conditional check to block junior developers or engineers, 
in order to refract the Jenkinsfile and the code so that a merge in the main branch is only possible if the pull request comes from the develop branch 
after having been validated for the feature branch.

Question 6

Here we can use the conditional multibuild job and implement the "when" condition for the flow from feature-develop-main.
We can also make sure a pull request should be submitted to a lead/senior engineer for a review before deploying into the main branch.
